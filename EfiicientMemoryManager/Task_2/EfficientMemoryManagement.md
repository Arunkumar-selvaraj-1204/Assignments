## Task 2

- Ask the user how many arrays need to be added to the list.
- For each array, get the size from the user.
- Allocate memory for each array based on the given size.
- Implement the `IDisposable` interface in the class.
- Add a `Dispose` method to the class.
- Use the `Dispose` method to clear the allocated memory when the object is no longer needed.
- This helps to manage memory better and avoid memory leaks.
