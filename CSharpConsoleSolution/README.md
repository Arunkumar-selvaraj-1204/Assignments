## Projects, Solutions, and Build Order

- I created a blank solution and added the following projects to the solution:  
  &emsp;- Project A: GreetingApp  
  &emsp;- Project B: MathApp  
  &emsp;- Project C: DisplayApp  
  &emsp;- Project D: UtilityApp  

- I added Project B (MathApp) as a dependency to Project A (GreetingApp).  
- I added Project C (DisplayApp) as a dependency to Project B (MathApp).  
- I added Project D (UtilityApp) as a dependency to Project C (DisplayApp).  

- When the solution is built, the build order starts with the project that has no dependencies. Before building a project, all of its dependencies are built first. For example, if Project A depends on Project B, Project B depends on Project C, and Project C depends on Project D, the build process starts with Project D, then proceeds to Project C, then Project B, and finally Project A.  

- Once the dependencies are set, the build order of the solution is:  
  **UtilityApp → MathApp →  DisplayApp → GreetingApp**

- I then created a new project, Project E, in the solution. After adding the new project, the build order of the solution becomes:  
  **UtilityApp → MathApp → DisplayApp → ProjectE → GreetingApp**
